The idea of the project is to use the resources provided by webgl (through three.js) to create a small educational game.
In this game, the user will control a small ghost that arrives every day in a seaside town called "Ghost Town" and needs to interact with 4 other ghosts (a **Ghost Princess** in a lighthouse, a **Reaper** who works in a bar, a **Witch** and a last character to be defined)

**Trello:** https://trello.com/b/AEAcJDyJ/ghost-town

# Demo

I'm constantly deploying my work-in-progress to the server, so a lot of pending work must be finalized. So far, you can access and start the demo by moving the ghost (using the arrows keys) and having a small interaction with the Lighthouse Princess.

**Demo (WORKING IN PROGRESS):** [https://learning-with-ghosts.herokuapp.com/](https://web-learning-with-ghosts-h4ru0dskx.vercel.app/c55dc669-7fa1-49da-a760-5c78f6fdcf38)

## Libs and Tools

-   Three.js (Three.js is a 3D library that tries to make it as easy as possible to get 3D content on a webpage) - https://threejs.org/
-   Lit (Lit is a simple library for building fast, lightweight web components) - https://lit.dev/
-   Typescript (TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.) - https://www.typescriptlang.org/
-   Express (Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.) - https://expressjs.com/
-   Tailwind (Tailwind CSS components & templates with support for React, Angular, & Vue) - https://tailwindui.com/
-   Web Test Runner (Test runner for web applications) - https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/#web-test-runner
-   Figrma (UI)
-   Blender (3D Models)
-   Trello (Kanban Board)

## Motivations

The main motivations to start and continuing to work on this project are:

-   **Explore different concepts and use of JavaScript that I haven't had the opportunity to work on in my professional projects.**
-   **Opportunity to use different tools and methods** - Using Lit instead of React was not only a decision for the size of the bundle, but also for working more deeply with web elements and webpack (which is bringing me immense satisfaction).
-   **Updating my tests concepts** - I've been working with Jest for testing for a long time and it's been a wonderful experience to work with another test library like Web Test Runner. I highly recommend her for other projects.
-   **The web is increasingly standardized.** I believe that using WebGl is a good method to bring different flavors to gamification for the sake of teaching.
